Description:



Nowadays, a lot of money is being wasted in the car insurance business due to leakage claims.Claims leakage Underwriting 
leakage is characterized as the discrepancy between the actual payment of claims made and the sum that should have been 
paid if all of the industry's leading practices were applied. Visual examination and testing have been used to may these 
results. However, they impose delays in the processing of claims.

            
The aim of this project is to build a VGG16 model that can detect the area of damage on a car. The rationale for such a model 
is that it can be used by insurance companies for faster processing of claims if users can upload pics and the model can assess damage
( be it dent scratch from and estimates the cost of damage. This model can also be used by lenders if they are underwriting a car loan, 
especially for a used car.
